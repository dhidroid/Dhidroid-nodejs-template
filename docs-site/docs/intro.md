# Introduction

Welcome to the **Dhidroid Node.js Template** 🚀

This repository provides a **production-ready Node.js REST API starter template** that helps you kick-start backend development without wasting time on repetitive setup. It is designed with **scalability, maintainability, and real-world usage** in mind.

Whether you are building a **prototype, MVP, or a full-scale backend service**, this template enables you to focus on **business logic instead of boilerplate code**.

---

## Why this template?

Modern backend projects often fail due to poor structure and rushed setup. This template solves that problem by offering:

- ⚙️ A clean and scalable Node.js project structure  
- 🔌 REST API–ready architecture  
- 🧩 Modular design for easy feature expansion  
- 🛡️ Environment-based configuration support  
- 🧪 Developer-friendly local development setup  
- 📦 Optimized for long-term maintenance and growth  

---

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** version **20.0 or above**
- **npm** (bundled with Node.js)
- Basic understanding of **JavaScript** and **REST APIs**

> 💡 Recommendation: When installing Node.js, enable all dependency-related options.
